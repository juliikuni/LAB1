## This is version 1 of initial mmp.c program.  

Here there are two main pragrams. One is getperf.sh script which just automates the execution of mmp in a loop so you can get time of a program when that is run with different parameters.

Second is mmp.c which is a c program doing matrix multiplication, which is modified version of the last week program.

The steps you need to do:

## This is version 1 of initial mmp.c program.  

Here there are two main pragrams. One is getperf.sh script which just automates the execution of mmp in a loop so you can get time of a program when that is run with different parameters.

Second is mmp.c which is a c program doing matrix multiplication, which is modified version of the last week program.

The steps you need to do:

You first compile mmp.c 
(1) $ gcc mmp.c -o mmp

(2) You can run this script.

$ ./getperf.sh 

This script gets execution time of ./mmp program and put that in data.txt file. 


To understand further, open mmp.c and getperf.sh to see what this program and script are doing and think how you can change the program to improve the execution time performance of mmp.c. Please understand what header files are used for which purpose. For example, understand how time is calculated and used. 

By running getperf.sh, we are learning how new processes started by just calling a utility funtion in a bash script.

Please note: you are not expected to learn details of bash script programming but we use this example to demonstrate that simple shell commands can be called in a batch mode. Please investigate what is pstree structure of these commands, means what is parent-child relationship when these three programs are executed -  bash shell, getperf script and ./mmp <arg>.


(Optional) If you are intrested, you can also plot your own generated data by the gerperf script, see sample code and data scripts in processing folder in this directory.


Next week task -  with our lecture 4 of SYS2, create new processes using fork command in the mmp.c and investigate how does a new process work and how much each fork command has an impact on kernel execution time and  on the total time.

Further, understand what is needed to optimise this program.

And discuss with your group members. Please post your suggestions or questions on VLE discussion forums for feedback, suggestions and peer-learning activity.
